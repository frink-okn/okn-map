      <p>This is a prototype of the Proto-OKN Map.</p>
      <p>It is generated through the following series of steps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>RDF data is processed into a LinkML schema using <a href="https://github.com/frink-okn/schema-gen" target="_blank">a set of scripts</a>.</li>
        <li>This schema is then itself turned into RDF using <a href="https://linkml.io/linkml/generators/rdf.html" target="_blank">the LinkML runtime's RDF generator</a>.</li>
        <li>The RDF representation of that schema is then directly queried with SPARQL using this interface.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>How is this used?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>At the start only Theme 1 graphs (in green) should be visible.</li>
        <li>Clicking on one of the Theme 1 graphs will display arrows pointing to other Theme 1 graphs, as well as other RDF ontologies (in gray), that are referred to by that graph.</li>
        <li>Clicking on a graph with references to or from it will expand to show a set of classes defined in that graph.</li>
        <li>Clicking on a class will, if there are mappings of that class to other classes, show links to those other classes.</li>
      </ul>
