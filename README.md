# OKN Map

This is the concept map for the Prototype Open Knowledge Network (Proto-OKN).

It displays relationships between Theme 1 graphs, external ontologies on which those graphs depend, and the classes and predicates defined and used in all of them. The relationships are taken from underlying Turtle files in the 'docker-backend' directory.

This map is built with Vue 3 and Vite (and, in principle, TypeScript).
