The HY_HydroFeature feature type is defined as hydrology-specific instance of the General Feature metaclass (as defined in the OGC General Feature Model, GFM), whose identity needs to be maintained and tracked through a processing chain from measurement to distribution of hydrologic information.␊As an instance of the General Feature metaclass a feature type is identified by a unique identifier and typical properties.

        "description: The Surface Hydro Feature application schema provides common concepts of hydrologic features occurring on the land surface and specifies the core concepts defined in the abstract Hydro Feature application schema. This will enable contextually linked information models to build relationships between multiple realizations of the same catchments. Typical realizations of the catchment concept and hydro nexuses can be described in a consistent way using standard terminology for the relationships between surface water features defined in this application schema.␊␊The Surface Hydro Feature model (Figure 37) conceptualizes the accumulation of water on the land surface in waterbodies, each made unique by its origin, size, or movement. With respect to the management and storage of water resources, a concept of water storage is provided and allows any waterbody type to be considered a managed reservoir.␊␊Relying on a conceptual separation of waterbody and container, the Surface Hydro Feature schema defines a network of potentially connected depressions and channels on the land surface which periodically or continuously contain water. Separate from the hydrographic network of permanent or temporary waterbodies, the channel network can be used as the connecting system.␊␊The definitions in this schema are rooted in the definitions given in the WMO/UNESCO Glossary of Hydrology which defines a network of watercourse regardless of the location in respect to the Earth's surface. The conceptual model defined here has been vetted in the context of surface water hydrology. In other words, in this standard, 'channel network' and 'hydrographic network' refer to surface channels or other containers for surface-waterbodies.␊␊The Surface Hydro Feature application schema contains the leaf packages: Channel Network, Hydrographic Network, Water Body Types and Storage.",
